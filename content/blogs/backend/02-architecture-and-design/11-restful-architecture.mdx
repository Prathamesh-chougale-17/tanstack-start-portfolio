title: RESTful Architecture and Best Practices
description: Building scalable REST APIs

## 1. What is REST?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

In simple words:

REST is a way to design APIs using:

- Resources
- HTTP methods
- Standard status codes
- Stateless communication

---

## 2. Core Principles of REST

### 1. Client–Server Architecture

- Client handles UI
- Server handles data and logic
- Both are independent

---

### 2. Stateless

Each request must contain all the information needed.

Server does NOT store session state between requests.

Example:

- Authentication token sent in every request

---

### 3. Resource-Based

Everything is treated as a resource.

Examples:

- users
- orders
- products
- payments

Resources are identified by URLs.

Example:

- `/users`
- `/users/{userId}`

---

### 4. Uniform Interface

REST APIs follow standard HTTP rules:

- GET → Read
- POST → Create
- PUT → Replace
- PATCH → Partial update
- DELETE → Remove

---

### 5. Cacheable

Responses should define whether they can be cached.

Use headers like:

- Cache-Control
- ETag

---

## 3. REST vs RESTful

- REST → architectural style
- RESTful API → API that follows REST principles
