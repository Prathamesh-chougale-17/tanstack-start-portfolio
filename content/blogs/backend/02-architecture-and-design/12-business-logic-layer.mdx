title: Business Logic Layer (BLL)
description: Separating business rules from data access
---

## What is Business Logic Layer?

Business Logic Layer (BLL) is the part of the application that contains:

- Core rules of the system
- Validation logic
- Decision making
- Calculations
- Workflows

It is the brain of the application.

## Where It Sits in Architecture

Typical layered architecture:

- Controller Layer (API Layer)
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Access Layer (Database Layer)

Flow:

Request → Controller → Business Logic → Database → Response

---

## What Should Be Inside BLL?

1. Business rules
2. Data validation (domain level)
3. Calculations
4. Orchestration between multiple services
5. Transaction handling

Example:

Creating an order:

- Check if user exists
- Check if product is in stock
- Calculate total price
- Apply discount
- Save order
- Reduce inventory

All this belongs in Business Logic Layer.

---

## What Should NOT Be Inside BLL?

- HTTP request parsing
- Response formatting
- Database queries (raw SQL)
- Framework-specific code

BLL should not depend on web framework.

---

## Why Separate Business Logic?

1. Reusability
2. Testability
3. Clean architecture
4. Easy maintenance
5. Separation of concerns

---

## Example (Simple Structure)

Controller:

- Accept request
- Call service method
- Return response

Service (Business Logic):

- Validate rules
- Perform operations
- Call repository

Repository:

- Handle database queries

---

## Key Principle

Controllers should be thin.

Business logic should be inside services.

If logic grows inside controller, move it to BLL.
