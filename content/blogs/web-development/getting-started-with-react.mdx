## Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Why React?

React allows you to build complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components". React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need.

## Key Concepts

### Components

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup. Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page.

```tsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
}
```

### Props

Props are arguments passed to React components. They are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

### State

State is memory for components. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the component.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm create react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

### Creating Your First Component

```tsx
import React from 'react'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Welcome to React</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Conclusion

React is a powerful library for building modern web applications. Its component-based architecture and rich ecosystem make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
