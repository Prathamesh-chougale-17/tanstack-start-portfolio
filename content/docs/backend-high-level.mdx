# Backend Development Roadmap

## High-Level Understanding

Backend development is the server-side part of web development. It focuses on databases, server logic, and system design. It connects the user interface with the database and handles business rules, data processing, and integrations.

---

## Core Responsibilities

A backend system must:

- Store and retrieve data
- Process business logic
- Manage authentication and authorization
- Ensure security
- Handle many users at the same time
- Stay reliable and available

The backend provides APIs that frontend apps use to work correctly.

---

## Architecture Patterns

Modern backends usually follow layered architecture:

- **Presentation layer** – APIs and controllers
- **Business layer** – rules and services
- **Data layer** – database access

This separation improves scalability, testing, and maintainability.

---

## System Components

A complete backend system includes:

- Web servers (handle HTTP requests)
- Application servers (business logic)
- Databases (data storage)
- Cache (fast data access)
- Message queues (background tasks)
- External services (payments, emails, etc.)

---

## HTTP Protocol

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines how clients and servers communicate on the web. Backend developers must understand how HTTP works to build APIs.

### Request–Response Cycle

- Client sends a request
- Server processes it
- Server sends a response

HTTP is stateless: each request is independent.

### HTTP Methods

- **GET** – Read data
- **POST** – Create data
- **PUT** – Replace data
- **PATCH** – Update part of data
- **DELETE** – Remove data
- **HEAD** – Headers only
- **OPTIONS** – Allowed actions

### Status Codes

- **1xx** – Info
- **2xx** – Success
- **3xx** – Redirect
- **4xx** – Client error
- **5xx** – Server error

### Headers and Body

- Headers carry metadata (auth, content type, cache)
- Body contains actual data (JSON, XML, etc.)

### Connection Management

- Persistent connections reuse connections
- HTTP/2 supports multiplexing for better performance

---

## Routing

Routing decides which code runs for a given URL and HTTP method.

### Route Definition

Routes map URLs to handlers. They can include:

- Static paths
- Dynamic parameters
- Query strings
- Wildcards

### Route Parameters

Dynamic values inside URLs allow operations on specific resources.

### Route Groups

Routes can be grouped with shared prefixes and middleware for clean structure.

---

## Serialization & Deserialization

- **Serialization** converts objects to transferable formats
- **Deserialization** converts data back to objects

### Common Formats

- JSON (most common for APIs)
- XML (legacy systems)
- Protocol Buffers (fast, binary)
- MessagePack (compact binary)
- YAML (configs)

### Security Note

Never trust incoming data. Always validate before deserialization.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication**: who the user is
- **Authorization**: what the user can do

### Common Methods

- Password-based
- Token-based (JWT)
- OAuth & OpenID Connect
- Multi-factor authentication

### Authorization Models

- Role-based (RBAC)
- Attribute-based (ABAC)
- Access control lists (ACL)

---

## Validation & Transformation

### Input Validation

- Validate type, length, and format
- Always validate on the server
- Prevent SQL injection and XSS

### Data Transformation

- Normalize values
- Convert date formats
- Sanitize strings

---

## Middleware

Middleware runs between request and response.

### Common Middleware

- Authentication
- Logging
- CORS
- Rate limiting
- Compression

### Ordering Matters

Middleware order affects behavior. Error handling usually comes last.

---

## Request Content Handling

### Content Types

- JSON
- Form data
- Multipart (file uploads)
- XML
- Plain text

### File Uploads

- Validate file type and size
- Use secure storage
- Scan for malware

---

## Handlers & Controllers

### Responsibilities

- Extract request data
- Validate input
- Call business logic
- Send response
- Handle errors

### Testing

Mock dependencies and test success and failure paths.

---

## CRUD Operations

- **Create** – Add new data
- **Read** – Fetch data
- **Update** – Modify data
- **Delete** – Remove data

### Best Practices

- Use transactions
- Handle concurrency
- Return correct status codes

---

## REST Best Practices

- Use resource-based URLs
- Use correct HTTP methods
- Keep response formats consistent
- Version APIs (/v1, /v2)

---

## Databases

### Types

- Relational (SQL)
- NoSQL (Document, Key-Value, Graph)

### Best Practices

- Use indexes
- Optimize queries
- Manage transactions
- Use migrations

---

## Business Logic Layer

- Contains core business rules
- Uses services and domain models
- Enforces data consistency

---

## Caching

### Cache Types

- In-memory
- Distributed
- Browser
- CDN

### Strategies

- Cache-aside
- Write-through
- TTL-based expiration

---

## Task Queues & Scheduling

- Handle background jobs
- Use workers
- Support retries and dead-letter queues

---

## Error Handling

- Separate user, system, and code errors
- Use consistent error formats
- Log errors with context

---

## Configuration Management

- Use environment variables
- Separate config from code
- Store secrets securely

---

## Logging, Monitoring & Observability

- Structured logs
- Metrics (latency, errors)
- Distributed tracing
- Health checks

---

## Security

- Validate all input
- Use HTTPS
- Apply least privilege
- Monitor security events

---

## Scaling & Performance

- Vertical scaling: bigger machines
- Horizontal scaling: more machines
- Load balancing
- Database scaling

---

## Concurrency & Async Processing

- Threads, event loops, actors
- Avoid race conditions
- Use async I/O

---

## Object Storage

- Store large files
- Use CDNs
- Process files asynchronously

---

## Real-Time Systems

- WebSockets
- Server-Sent Events
- Pub/Sub messaging

---

## Testing & Code Quality

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- CI pipelines

---

## 12 Factor App Principles

- One codebase
- Environment-based config
- Stateless processes
- Logs as streams

---

## OpenAPI Standards

- API documentation
- Schema definitions
- Code generation
- Contract testing

---

## DevOps Basics

- Infrastructure as Code
- Containers (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- CI/CD

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap covers backend development from basics to advanced systems. Learn step by step, practice with real projects, and keep improving. Backend mastery comes with time, repetition, and real-world problem solving.
