## Advanced TypeScript Concepts

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. Let's explore some advanced concepts.

### Generics

Generics allow you to create reusable components that work with a variety of types:

```tsx
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg
}

const output = identity<string>('Hello')
```

### Utility Types

TypeScript provides several utility types to transform types:

#### Partial

Makes all properties optional:

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
}

function updateUser(id: number, fields: Partial<User>) {
  // Update only provided fields
}
```

#### Pick and Omit

Create new types by picking or omitting properties:

```tsx
type UserPreview = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>
type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, 'email'>
```

### Conditional Types

Create types that depend on other types:

```tsx
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T
```

### Mapped Types

Transform types property by property:

```tsx
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use strict mode** in tsconfig.json
2. **Avoid `any` type** - use `unknown` when you truly don't know the type
3. **Use interfaces for object shapes** and types for unions, primitives, or computed types
4. **Leverage type inference** when possible
5. **Use const assertions** for immutable literals

## Conclusion

Mastering TypeScript requires practice, but it significantly improves code quality and developer experience in the long run.
